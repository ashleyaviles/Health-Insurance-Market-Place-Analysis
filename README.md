Exploring Boulder Colorado’s Individual Health Insurance Market in 2021

Who participates in Boulder’s Individual Insurance Market?
 
Boulder, Colorado is the 12th most populous city in Colorado. Boulder residents reside in a competitive induvial insurance market. The Boulder, Colorado market has a total of seven insurance companies offering coverage through the individual market. Collectively the insurers are offering 86 different plans (figure 1). The types of plans offered by the insurers on the market are primarily Health Maintenance Organizations (57%) or Exclusive Provider Organizations (43%). Within the market Anthem, Friday Health, Kaiser Permanente, and Rocky Mountain Health all exclusively offer HMO plans, while Bright Health, Cigna, and Oscar offer exclusively EPO plans. While the market has plenty of health plans to choose from, the types of plans (EPOs and HMOs) leave Boulder residents with insurance plans with little flexibility to choose providers outside of their selected plan’s provider network.

What kind of health insurance can a resident more readily get? 
Residents can ger all metal levels are offered except Platinum plans. This means residents are not given the option of having one of the most generous insurance plans available throughout other insurance markets. Silver plans are the most prevalent plans with 35 offered on the market, followed by Expanded Bronze plans with 25, Gold plans with 13, Bronze with seven, and lastly, Catastrophic plans with six plans offered in the market (See Figure 2).  Since Silver plans are the most common metal level plans in the market, residents are more likely to have a plan that covered about 70% of their healthcare costs.

Anthem offers the most variety of health plans to Boulder residents with 22 total plans, followed by Bright Health with 16 plan offerings and both Oscar and Kaiser Permanente with 12 different plans.  However, Anthem’s average premium of $313.89* is the most expensive insurance carrier in the market with a premium of $313.89 compared to the market average of $289.72 (See Figure 3). Anthem on average also has the most expensive plan across all metal levels compared to its competitors. On the other hand, Bright Health offers the second most variety in the market but is less expensive than the market average monthly premium. Cigna offers little variety to the market, with only 12 plan offerings, but its monthly premium is the second most expensive than the market average.

Most Affordable Health Insurance Plans

In the Boulder market, there are mostly Silver plans, but if relatively healthy residents want to get a cheaper health plan there are few options to choose from. Half of the cheapest plans are in the market are Catastrophic plans (See Figure 4). However, only those under 30 years of age and those that meet the plan requirements are eligible to enroll in these plans. Therefore, the options residents have to choose from save them little compared to normal Silver plans.

The future of Colorado’s Individual Marketplace

 In terms of competition, individual market shoppers have many different carriers to choose from in this market and different health plans to choose from as well. To be able to compete, while meeting the federally mandated guidelines, in highly competitive environments insurers tend to move towards more narrow networks and cut out plans to be able to control their premium prices. Premiums are the primary way to attract more enrollees since they are willing to trade breadth of network and benefits for lower premiums. Based on this and the Boulder market I believe that the lower premium carriers such as Oscar and Friday Health will pressure the highest priced carriers-- Anthem, Cigna, and Kaiser Permanente-- to lower their premiums. A way that they might choose to do so is by slashing the number of plans they offer in the market. Therefore, the market can potentially see these three carriers reduce the number of more prevalent plans in the market (Expanded_bronze and Silver plans) or the most generous plans on the market (Silver, and Gold plans) (See Figure 5). On the other hand, Cigna which already has a small number of offerings, yet has an on average more expensive monthly premium, might not choose to lessen the number of plans they offer but play around with the metal level offerings and their actuarial values. Overall, these carriers are in a competitive market and can choose to compete by lower the number of plans offered and revisiting which metal-level plans they offer. Thus, this might leave the residents of Boulder with a tighter market during open enrollment for 2022.
